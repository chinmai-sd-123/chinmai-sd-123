##  About Me

I am an aspiring **Machine Learning & AI Engineer** focused on **data understanding, feature engineering, model evaluation, and system design**. My goal is to build systems that are **correct, interpretable, and production-ready**.

> *I believe strong AI systems are built on solid ML foundations, good data, and clear assumptions, not just advanced models.*

Currently, I am progressively transitioning from classical ML workflows toward **AI-driven and GenAI-based applications**.
