# Hi, I'm Chinmai SD

I am an aspiring **Machine Learning & AI Engineer** focused on building **robust, end-to-end intelligent systems**.  
My work emphasizes **data understanding, feature engineering, model evaluation, and system design**, while progressively moving toward **AI-driven and GenAI-based applications**.

I prefer building systems that are **correct, interpretable, and deployable**, rather than relying on complexity for its own sake.

I believe strong AI systems are built on **solid ML foundations, good data, and clear assumptions**, not just advanced models.
