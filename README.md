# Hi, I'm Chinmai SD

I am an aspiring **Machine Learning Engineer** focused on building **robust, end-to-end ML systems**.  
My work emphasizes **data understanding, feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment**, rather than relying on unnecessarily complex models.

I enjoy solving real-world problems where machine learning meets **practical constraints and system design**.

I believe strong ML systems are built by **understanding data, assumptions, and failure modes**, not by defaulting to complex models.
