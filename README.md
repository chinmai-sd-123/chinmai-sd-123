# Hi there, I'm Chinmai! 👋  

I'm an aspiring **Machine Learning & AI Engineer** with a strong interest in building data-driven systems and intelligent applications.  
I focus on **understanding data, engineering features, and building models that generalize well**, rather than blindly using complex algorithms.

⭐ *I believe strong ML systems are built by understanding data, assumptions, and generalization — not just by using complex models.*
